# MyEncrypt-Decrypt
Custom Encryption/decryption algorithm in C that reads a user password and XORâ€™s each character in the file with a letter in the password. Once all letters in the password are used, the password is rehashed into a new password. This means the key is never the same for each block of encryption/decryption.

NOTE: This is a personal side project and is not secure.
